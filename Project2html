Natural occurances have over the years brought about huge benefits to mankind. But there are instances where these occurances are of negative consequences to our developments. Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern. This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage. We will attempt to answer some useful questions that will enhance decision making.

```{r INTRODUCTION , include=FALSE}
setwd("C:/Users/HP/OneDrive/Documents/R/coursera/reproduceable research/Reproduecable research2")
```
The following libraries will be used for data manipulations, transformation and analysis.

```{r Load necessary library, echo=TRUE}
library(lubridate)
library(quantmod)
library(xtable)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(data.table)
library(R.utils)
library(ggrepel)
library(choroplethr)
```
#1. DATA PROCESSING

The data for this project is in a comma-separated-value file compressed via the bzip2 algorithm to reduce its size which can be downloaded from the course web site [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2). There are also some documentation of the database available. Here you will find how some of the variables are constructed/defined.

National Weather Service [Storm Data Documentation](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2Fpd01016005curr.pdf)

National Climatic Data Center Storm Events [FAQ](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fpeer2_doc%2FNCDC%20Storm%20Events-FAQ%20Page.pdf)

The events in the database start in the year 1950 and end in November 2011. In the earlier years of the database there are generally fewer events recorded, most likely due to a lack of good records

The following codes will read the data into our environment and perform preliminary exploration.
```{r Reading the data and performing EDA, echo=TRUE}
### Reading the data and processing the data
stormdata <- as.data.table(read.csv(bzfile("C:/Users/HP/OneDrive/Documents/R/coursera/reproduceable research/Reproduecable research2/StormData.csv.bz2")))
dim(stormdata)
head(stormdata)
colnames(stormdata)
str(stormdata)
```

From the EDA we discover that our data is a data table as well as a data frame consisting of 902297 observation points with 37 varaibles. The colnames provides us with the column labels which include: "STATE", "BGN_Date", "MAG" etc. The str command gives us the structural information about the data. We notice that some varaibles are factors, numbers, logic, integer type etc.

The data include a whole lot of information which might not be of interest to us based on the research questions we wish to answer viz:

1. Across the United States, which types of events are most harmful with respect to    population health?
2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic         consequences?

##1.1.  VARIABLE SUBSETTING AND PROCESSING

To answer the above questions we will subset a portion of the data that will enable us provide answers to our puzzle. The following chunks will help us in subsetting and performing necessary data cleaning and processing.Here, weâ€™ll take only the necessary columns required to answer the two objective questions. These are:
```{r variable of interest, echo=TRUE}
a <- data.frame(varaible = c( "EVTYPE", "INJURIES", "FATALITIES", 
                              "PROPDMG",    "PROPDMGEXP", "CROPDMG", 
                              "CROPDMGEXP"), 
                meaning = c("Event type", "Number of injuries", 
                            "number of fatalities",  "Property damage", 
                            "Magnitude of property damage", "crop damage", 
                            "magntude of crop damage" ))

a

```
Therefore we will subset the above set of variables, perform transformation where necessary and remove all NA's and replace the zeros using mean. Also we will perform column class manipulations for easy use later on. The variables "PROPDMGEXP" and "CROPDMGEXP" contain exponents and lower case letters which are mistyped; we will attempt to assign equivalent values based on the documentation and correct the capitalization to make the variables useful for our computation. But first we start with subsetting. The codes below does the job.

```{r varaible subsetting and processing, echo=TRUE}
substormdata <- stormdata[ , .(EVTYPE = as.factor(EVTYPE), INJURIES = as.numeric(INJURIES), FATALITIES = as.numeric(FATALITIES), PROPDMG = as.numeric(PROPDMG), PROPDMGEXP = as.factor(PROPDMGEXP), CROPDMG = as.numeric(CROPDMG), CROPDMGEXP = as.factor(CROPDMGEXP))]
str(substormdata)
```

##1.2. CLEANING PROPDMGEXP and CROPDMGEXP COLUMNS

The "PROPDMGEXP" and "CROPDMGEXP" have some of its exponents mistyped with upper or lower case, we will clean that up as well as associate numeric values to these exponents. The chunks of code below does the job.

```{r change to uppercase, echo=TRUE}
####change to uppercase
cprop <- c("PROPDMGEXP", "CROPDMGEXP")
substormdata[,  (cprop) := c(lapply(.SD, toupper)), .SDcols = cprop]

```

```{r Map property and crop damage alphanumeric exponents to numeric values, echo=TRUE}
# Map property and crop damage alphanumeric exponents to numeric values.
propDmgKey <-  c("\"\"" = 10^0, "-" = 10^0, "+" = 10^0, "?" = 10^0,  "0" = 10^0,
                 "1" = 10^1, "2" = 10^2, "3" = 10^3, "4" = 10^4,
                 "5" = 10^5, "6" = 10^6, "7" = 10^7, "8" = 10^8,
                 "9" = 10^9, "H" = 10^2, "K" = 10^3, "M" = 10^6, "B" = 10^9)

cropDmgKey <-  c("\"\"" = 10^0, "?" = 10^0, "0" = 10^0, "2" = 10^2, "k" = 10^3, "K" = 10^3, "m" = 10^6, "M" = 10^6, "B" = 10^9)
```

That done, we will associate the exponents numeric keys to the associated variables in the data.

```{r associate the exponents numeric, echo=TRUE}
substormdata[, PROPDMGEXP := propDmgKey[as.character(substormdata[,PROPDMGEXP])]]
substormdata[is.na(PROPDMGEXP), PROPDMGEXP := 10^0 ]

substormdata[, CROPDMGEXP := cropDmgKey[as.character(substormdata[,CROPDMGEXP])] ]
substormdata[is.na(CROPDMGEXP), CROPDMGEXP := 10^0 ]
```

Based on our question, since we are going to assess the impact of the weather on human damage, we will create new variables that will enable us compute the extent and cost of these phenomenon on humans.  We will compute the total injuries and fatalities recorded as a results of these natural events, as well as compute the total damage done on humans. These are captured in the variable: "injsum", "fatalsum" and "sumHumanDamage". This is acheived below:
```{r additional columns, echo=TRUE}
###Columns relevant to Human Damage(injury, fatality and totalhumandamange)
substormdata[ , ':='(injsum = sum(INJURIES), fatalsum = sum(FATALITIES)),
              by = EVTYPE][ ,':='(sumHumanDamage = injsum + fatalsum)]

str(substormdata)

```

Similarly, to compute economic damage we will require to create additional variable to account for total property damage (captured as "proptotal"), total crop damage (captured as "croptotal") and the overall economic damage total (captured as "ECODMGTOT"). Total property damage is calculated by multiplying property damage and its magnitude; total crop damage is calculated by multiplying crop damage and its magnitude; and finally total economic damage is obtained by summing total property damage and total crop damage.

```{r Additional varaible for economic damage, echo=TRUE}
newsubstormdata <- substormdata[, ':='(proptotal = sum(PROPDMG * PROPDMGEXP ,
                                    na.rm = T)), by = EVTYPE][ , 
                                  ':='(croptotal = sum(CROPDMG * CROPDMGEXP, 
                                  na.rm = T)), by = EVTYPE][  , ':='(ECODMGTOT =                                       proptotal + croptotal)]


str(newsubstormdata)
```

#2. RESULTS
Recall that we wish to answer the following questions:
1. Across the United States, which types of events are most harmful with respect to    population health?
2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic         consequences?

## Question 1: Across the United States, which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health?

To answer the above, we will measure which of the events (there are about 900+ recorded events) have the greatest records of fatalities and injuries assuming that public health is majorly affected by those varaibles alone. The results below indicates that the event "TORNADO" had the highest fatalities and injuries record. Also performing a combine human damage also indicated "TORNADO" had the highest record. It should be noted that only a section of 20 was displayed and plotted for sake of plot table dimension.
```{r Most harmful event, echo=TRUE}
MHE <- distinct(newsubstormdata[ , .(EVTYPE, injsum, fatalsum, sumHumanDamage)])
MHEinj <- MHE[order(MHE$injsum, decreasing = TRUE), .(EVTYPE, injsum)][1:20, ]
MHEfatal <- MHE[order(MHE$fatalsum, decreasing = TRUE), .(EVTYPE, fatalsum)][1:20, ]
MHEhumanDamage <- MHE[order(MHE$sumHumanDamage, decreasing = TRUE), .(EVTYPE, sumHumanDamage)][1:20, ]
##only first twenty most harmful events used
#MHE implies most harmful events
#MHEinj implies most harmful events that result to injuries
#MHEfatal implies mst harmful events that results to fatalities
#MHEhumanDamage implies most harmful events for combined total human damage

```

We will combine all most harmful events with respect to population health into a singular data frame and plot it out on the bar chart.

```{r Events with greatest human damage, echo=TRUE}
allMHE <- merge(merge(MHEinj, MHEfatal), MHEhumanDamage) 

allMHE

```

Using a panel plot to produce the bar charts 

```{r Most harmful events with respect to public health, echo=TRUE}
# Create chart for allMHE
par(mfrow = c(1,2), mar = c(5.1, 4.1, 4.1, 2.1))
barplot(allMHE$fatalsum, names.arg = allMHE$EVTYPE
        , main = "Events by Total fatalities"
        , ylab = "Number of fatalities (000s)", las = 3, col = "red")
barplot(allMHE$injsum, names.arg = allMHE$EVTYPE
        , main = "Events by Total injuries"
        , ylab = "Number of injuries (000s)", las = 3, col = "blue")
```

To plot total human damage caused by events the following codes:
```{r Barplot for total human damage, echo=TRUE}
barplot(allMHE$sumHumanDamage, names.arg = allMHE$EVTYPE
        , main = "Combined events for injuries & Fatalities"
        , ylab = "Number of Injuries & Fatalities (000s)", las = 3, col = "green")
```

##Question 2: Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

As done in previous section we will calculate economic damage done on properties, crop and the total economic damage and plot the bar chart to reveal which of the events have the greatest consequences.

```{r Events with greatest economic consequences, echo=TRUE}
economy <- newsubstormdata %>% group_by(EVTYPE) %>% summarize(total.econs.damage = sum(ECODMGTOT)) %>% arrange(desc(total.econs.damage))
TECOAFT <- head(economy, n = 20)
TECOAFT

property <- newsubstormdata %>% group_by(EVTYPE) %>% summarize(total.property.damage = sum(proptotal)) %>% arrange(desc(total.property.damage))
TPTYcons <- head(property, n = 20)
TPTYcons

crop <- newsubstormdata %>% group_by(EVTYPE) %>% summarize(total.crop.damage = sum(croptotal)) %>% arrange(desc(total.crop.damage))
topcropcons <- head(crop, n = 20)
topcropcons
```

The bar chart below gives the result

```{r Barchart of events with greatest economic consequences, echo=TRUE}
# Create chart for allMHE
par(mfrow = c(1,2), mar = c(11, 5, 4, 4))
barplot(TECOAFT$total.econs.damage, names.arg = TECOAFT$EVTYPE
        , main = "Top Economic Damage events"
        , ylab = "Total Economic Damage", las = 3, col = "Dark green")
barplot(topcropcons$total.crop.damage, names.arg = topcropcons$EVTYPE
        , main = "Top Crop Damage events"
        , ylab = "Total Crop Damage", las = 3, col = "magenta")
```
To plot total economic damage the following code does it for us.

```{r Barplot for total economic damage, echo=TRUE}

barplot(TPTYcons$total.property.damage, names.arg = TPTYcons$EVTYPE
        , main = "Top Property Damage events"
        , ylab = "Total property Damage", las = 3, col = "orange")
```

#3. CONCLUSION

From our result above, the following are concluded upon:
 1. Tonado happen to be the most dangerous event that affects public     health causing numerous injuries and fatalities seconded by         blizzards.
 2. Hail, flood and tonado happen to be the events with the greatest     economic consequences.
